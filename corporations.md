# Corporations

```
Iridium Ops is a free association of corporations... an alliance of sorts if you want.
```

## New Eden Independent Corporation

We are here to have fun together, to learn and get better at pvp, to share knowledge and work together to achieve more than an individual could alone while making loads of ISK and gettig cool killmails.

We are meritocratic, no elitism, you are free to join any fleet. We are *in universe corp*, that means, while we are not roleplayers we try to avoid use or irl equivalents, irl culture, current year themes and memes etc.

We are causal players, real life comes first.

What do we do?

- PvE missions, ratting, exploration, abyss
- PvP daily fleets
   - small gangs
   - hunting
   - roams
   - gate camps
- LowSec and FW piracy
- Trade
- Planetary Interaction
- Where we are: Lonetrek and nearby regions
- We roam in LowSec, NullSec, sometimes WHs

If you are interested or have any questions, contact us, we will be happy to answer all your questions.
And if you are experienced player, than help us lead and expand.
