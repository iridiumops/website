# Corporations

```
Iridium Ops is a free association of corporations... an alliance of sorts if you want. Yet not limited by ingame mechanics.
```

## New Eden Independent Corporation

The leading corporation of IridiumOps.

We are here to have fun together, to learn and get better at PVP, to share knowledge and work together to achieve more than an individual could do alone, while making loads of ISK and getting cool killmails.

We are meritocratic, no elitism, you are free to join any fleet. We are an *in universe corp*, that means, while we are not roleplayers, we try to avoid use or irl equivalents, irl culture, current year themes and memes etc.

Casuals are welcomed, real life comes first.

### What do we do?

Little bit of everything, to keep the game fun and not to burn out. Our activities include, but are not limited to:

- PvE missions, ratting, exploration, abyss
- PvP daily fleets
   - small gangs
   - hunting
   - roams
   - gate camps
- LowSec and FW piracy
- Trade
- Planetary Interaction

Where we are: Lonetrek and nearby regions
Where we roam: LowSec, NullSec, sometimes WHs

If you are interested or have any questions, contact us, we will be happy to answer all your questions.
And if you are experienced player, than help us lead and expand.
