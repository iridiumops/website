# Alts and Multiboxing

Alts are a way for you to organize your activities and benefit from specialization and paralelisation of skill training. Multiboxing allows you to do things you would otherwise need other persons help. Both are encouraged by CCP (Crowd Control Productions - the game developer, not the Chinese Communist Party).

## Training

EVE Online has been around (at the time of writing) for 20 years, alts are the single biggest thing that will help you to catch up with the veterans of the game. It could take a while to get to 60, 80, or even 200m SP, but if you split that amount among 2, 3 or more accounts it will take a fraction of the time. 

New players benefits also from skill injectors and free SP drops, SP rewards and generally higher attribute numbers, accelerators (especially the ones from events), and can on average expect to reach parity of capabilities with 4-5 years, just split among more characters.

Subscription, wheter bought for PLEX or directly with money, allows training only one of the characters on your account at a time. If you want to train multiple characters you can purchase MCT for one of two of them (Multiple Character Training, available again both ingame for PLEX in NES - New Eden Store and the out of game EVE Store for RL currency).

Free alpha accounts can passively train up to 5m SP, but can accumulate and use skill points up to roughly 21m SP via injectors of all types. Omega accounts have no such limitations and can train passively at full speed compared to half speed of alphas.

## Account types and multiboxing

Alphas are limited to single client, so no multiboxing for you, but you can still benefit from alts in various ways. Omega accounts can be freely multiboxed. Each account gets up to 3 characters, only one can be logged in at the same time (well, technically not true, but you can only control one at a time). You are free to create and delete them, but that is usually very wasteful.

## Tools

Different tools to help switch clients, sync UI settings and plan skills exist. The most popular tools are listed here: https://iridiumops.uk.to/#!/articles/tools.md

## Hardware

Dedicated GPU is needed but basically any GPU made in last 10 years will work, multiboxing on integrated GPUs leads to very bad experience. Requirements wise, rule of thumb is minimum 1 CPU core and 2GB of RAM per running account on reasonable settings, but you can do it with less if you are willing to use full potato graphics, turn off all sound, and even some effects.

## What to avoid

Avoid EULA breaking tools and alt use. This includes most notably client modifications, input broadcasting, action automation and macro use, ui slicing and splicing, botting, account sharing, network data mining, running multiple alpha accounts at the same time or at the same time as an omega account.

Even though the practice of using second separate computer to multibox alpha characters is very common and rarely punished, don't risk it, people do get banned sometimes.

While not forbidden afaik, using VMs to run clients, connecting via proxies and VPNs, and use of cloud gaming services can lead to problems with CCP.

## Cost

At 20â‚¬ / month plus tax and currency conversion fees per omega account, EVE may seem like truly expensive hobby once you need an alt, two or more. It is currently the most expensive MMO. And unfortunately CCP does not offer regional pricing. Fortunately various discounts exist:

- Multiple account discount applies to subscription of your second, third, etc account linked together via same email.
- Multiple month discounts. 3, 6, 12 and 24 month subscription offers increasing discounts.
- CCP regularly offers deals and discounts on omega time, plex and various packs.
- It is often worth it to buy PLEX instead and use ingame New Eden Store to sub with PLEX, which also offers 3, 6, 12 and 24 month subscription discounts and other deals.
- Using verified 3rd party sellers like Green Man Gaming, Humble Bundle, Markee Dragon store and others will get you often further small discounts and better currency conversion rates than what CCP run EVE Store offers.

With right timing and discounts you can get your sub cost down to nearly 5$ per month per omega.

Once your character or account is fully trained for what you want to do with it, you can significantly subsidize your account with skillfarming. With optimal approach, implants, remap, 12m+ subscription or right discount and right market orders it can even generate small surplus of isk (at least at the time of writing), allowing you to play for free as omega at the cost of no skill training. 

Skillfarming used to be much more profitable but as people figure it out competition increases and profit evaporates. Skillfarming is also risky and volatile as it depends on PLEX and extractor sales. More info here: https://iridiumops.uk.to/#!/tools/skill_calc.md

Earning ISK to PLEX your account is more than possible, but should not be your main goal, especially if you are new to the game. It can easily turn EVE into a job or lead to a burnout. If you live in a western country, it is likely much more time efficient to buy subscription than to buy PLEX with ISK.

If you still want to earn ISK to buy PLEX, I would suggest waiting until you are comfortably established in EVE and have some skills trained. Then depending on what you consider fun, many of the activities listed below can be low effort or even passive, others can be fun and even lucrative allowing you to PLEX with ISK while doing something enjoyable. 

It is common to subscribe some accounts with RL currency and additional alts with PLEX bought for ISK. 

Alpha account is also not as limiting as it once was and you can have as many as you want, each specialized in something else, maybe a different ship, weapon system or activity.

## Activities and alt types

Non-exhaustive list of common activities and uses for alts. You can combine pretty much any of them.

### Capital alts

It is usually recommended to train capital ships on an alt so you can multibox them and use your main at the same time. To move them around you will need preferably yet another alt that is multiboxable which will light cynosural fields (cynos for short).

Cap alts can be used for various purpose; PVP, PVE CRAB beacons, boosts, mining, ratting, hauling, bridging, etc...

3 types of cap alts are common, as they share most skills:

- dread -> titan
- carrier -> supercarrier
- fax <-> rorqual

### PVP and combat support alts

There are endless types and combinations of ships and pvp roles your alt can do.

- cyno -> cyno hunter -> covert cyno hunter
- scout -> tackle interceptor
- boosher (command destroyer with MJD) 
- links (command bursts on a command ship, command destroyer, BC or T3C)
- ECM and EWAR in general
- interdictor
- logistics (shield, armor or both)
- bomber
- general purpose subcap combat alts
- blops (black ops battleship) bridge
- titan bridge (see capital alts)
- ESS thief (cruiser)

### Industry alts

Many of the activities are partially passive. Mining is a low APM activity the easily scales with number of accounts.

- mining barge (moons, belts, anoms, etc...)
- mining frigate - venture, prospect,... (moon, gas, ice)
- mining boosts - porpoise -> orca -> rorqual
- industrial cyno (to move the rorqual)
- research
- BP invention, research, copying
- PI (extraction)
- PI (factory planets)
- reactions
- reprocessing
- manufacturing (t1 -> faction -> t2 -> capitals)

### Hauling

Even though great hauling services exists, both traders and industrialists will greatly benefit from their own hauling alts.

- T1 hauler
   lows sp, low value hauler
- DST (deep space transport)
   best hisec hauler
- BR (blockade runner)
   for lowsec and dangerous space
- Freighter
   high volume hauler
- JF (jump freighter)
   when you dont want to be limited by gates, potentially safest hauler, but mistakes will cost you a lot
- Epithal hauler
   convenient hauler for PI
- small volume, high value hauler (interceptor, yacht, T3D, T3C, Sunesis)
- scout + webber

### Trade

- station trader (in jita/amarr/dodixie/hek/rens)
   buy cheap with buy orders, sell with sell orders in the same station for more
- region trader and market seeder
   buy at one place (usually jita), get it hauled, sell for more in different place (usually small trade hub, mission hub, fw hub or corp staging)
- contract seeder
   seeds fitted ships, usually corp doctrines on contracts for steady profit
- buyback
   buys stuff at discount, uses them for manufacturing or sells in a trade hub
- broker
   buys and sells in bulk making small profit and voids taxes via contracts
- "the jita alt"
   used to check market prices, buy, sell, receive and create contracts
   useful for low sec status pirates, gankers, pilots in hostile fw, wardeced corporations, nullsec alliances and generally everyone staging from somewhere far from jita - the largest trade hub.

### Other

- SP farm
   skillfarming can help to subsidize your fully trained characters
- citadel gunner
- corp holder
- spy + awoxer
- cloaky camper, eyes
- ganker (usually catalyst or tornado)
- salvager (usually destroyer or noctis)
- ninja looter
- drone "rescue" scanner
- scammer, thief
- cosmos and epic arc mission runner
- project discovery farmer

### WH alts

Even in a good corp, wormhole content and especially higher class WHs require a lot of alts. Nomad lifestyle and day-triping can reduce it a little.

- wh pvp
   (preferably cloaky and stealth ships, ships invisible on dscan, see PVP alts)
- wh site running
   (t3c/praxis/rattlesnake 1+) (leshak/marauder/dreadnought 3+)
- wh scanner prober
- wh scout (cloaked to collect intel and provide early warning, place on every hole and in the chain)
- wh explorer for pirate data and relic sites
- wh gas and ore miner (see mining)
- wh roller (BS, HIC)
- wh evacuation hauler / shattered wh cargo ship
- logged off alpha wh holder (emergency backup reverse route scanner)

### PVE alts

Nearly any activity can be multiboxed. Number signifies the typical, optimal or required number of accounts.

- anom ratting, belt officer/soldier hunter, escalation farming, unrated/ded combat exploration (vexor/myrm/gila/ishtar/stratios/t3c) 1+
