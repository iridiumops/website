# Iridium Ops, an EVE Online player group

Warning! Website in active development.

Note: we are currently winning eve, but we might come back soon<sup>TM</sup>.

## Why Iridium Ops?

*Don't be a Slave of your CEO, join us in Iridium Ops. We will welcome you on our Friend Ship, where we have plenty of Exotic Dancers, Wine, Spirits and Quafe! In our spare time, when we are not shooting enemy ships or making ISK, we keep Fedos as our pets and we are willing to trade some for good intel on krabs, carebears and our enemies in null blobs of blue donut.*
