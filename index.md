## Why Iridium Ops?

*Don't be a [Slave](https://everef.net/type/3721) of your CEO, join us in Iridium Ops. We will welcome you on our [Friend Ship](https://everef.net/type/34436), where we have plenty of [Exotic Dancers](https://everef.net/type/17765), [Wine](https://everef.net/type/42), [Spirits](https://everef.net/type/9850) and [Quafe](https://everef.net/type/3699)! In our spare time, when we are not shooting enemy ships or making ISK, we keep [Fedos](https://everef.net/type/26902) as our pets and we are willing to trade some for good intel on krabs, carebears and our enemies in null blobs of blue doughnut.*
