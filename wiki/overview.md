# Iridium Overview Pack

## What is an overview pack?

Internet spaceships are a serious business and so are overviews. The overview window is the most important part of EVE user interface, but it is the hardest thing to configure correctly, yet your ship's life depends on it. If you don't believe us, listen to [EVE university](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview):

> The overview window is one of the most essential components of EVE's user interface and is the primary means of viewing items in space.... Though it can be time-consuming to configure, the flexibility and effectiveness of a properly-configured overview justifies the time spent.
>
> <cite>EVE University</cite>

The default overview is going to get your shiny space ship killed. But you are in luck! There are multiple different overview configuration packs, maintained by other players, that will help you get good overview setup without having to deal with overcomplicated settings and configuration and hoping you set it up right, so you don't confuse your corpmate with an NPC pirate. 

Though not all overview packs are made equal and which to use will depend on your play style and preferences. Iridium Overview is one of such player made overview packs. And we think it's the best. For over 10 years, Iridium Overview provided frequent and timely updates, earning trust of hundreds of players.

### TL;DR

1. Good overview can greatly help you orient on grid and achieve what you need. 
2. Bad overview, on the other hand, can get you and your friends killed.
3. It is hard to get it right by yourself, and it takes so much time.
4. Be smart, use an overview pack, use Iridium Overview!

## Iridium Overview Pack

Overview pack designed for every EVE player, newbie or veteran. This overview will be useful in both fleet and solo PVP, ratting, mining, looting, exploration etc. and in all types of space.

12 tabs, 38 overview presets, 3 bracket presets and 3 d-scan presets is the perfect balance between large complicated and too simplistic overviews. Alternative presets provide easy yet good customization for your playstyle.

Iridium Overview uses standardized colors and naming making it compatible with any nullsec bloc.

### Don't like it?

No problem, try some other overview pack from list of **EVE Overviews** (ingame chat channel). They are used by tens of thousands capsuleers across New Eden.

### Known issues

- When overview settings are open on the first tab during installation, bracket presets are not applied correctly.
- Local chat standing badges are occasionally not updated automatically and require relog or change of system.
- Various other color settings may not immediately apply and may require docking and undocking or preferably logging off and logging back in. Alternatively in words of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche:

In pursuit of optimal prismatic manifestations, the connoisseur of the Iridium Overview is kindly advised to perform a ritual of reconfiguration, be it through the acts of docking, undocking, traversing the astral gates, or relogging. These measures shall ensure the harmonious convergence of color palettes across the domains of local, the overview, and the boundless expanses of space.

### NEW: Finally Open Source!

After years of solitary development, I'm excited to release Iridium Overview to you as open source.

Feel free to explore the project, propose changes, updates or enhancements. Every bit of help counts. Your contributions can make significant impact!
