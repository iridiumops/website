# Iridium Overview Pack

## What is an Overview Pack?

Internet spaceships are a serious business and so are overviews. The overview window is the most important part of EVE user interface, but it is the hardest thing to configure correctly, yet your ship's life depends on it.  If you don't believe us, listen to [EVE university](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview):

> The overview window is one of the most essential components of EVE's user interface and is the primary means of viewing items in space.... Though it can be time-consuming to configure, the flexibility and effectiveness of a properly-configured overview justifies the time spent.

The default overview is going to get your shiny space ship killed. But you are in luck! There are multiple different overview configuration packs, maintained by other players, that will help you get good overview setup without having to deal with overcomplicated settings and configuration and hoping you set it up right, so you don't confuse your corpmate with an NPC pirate. 

Though not all overview packs are made equal and which to use will depend on your play style and preferences. Iridium Overview is one of such player made overview packs. And we think it's the best. For over 10 years, Iridium Overview provided frequent and timely updates, earning trust of hundreds of players.

### TL;DR

1.  Good overview can greatly help you orient on grid and achieve what you need. 
2. Bad overview, on the other hand, can get you and your friends killed.
3. It is hard to get it right by yourself.
4. Be smart, use an overview pack, use Iridium Overview!

## Iridium Overview Pack

Overview pack designed for every EVE player, newbie or veteran. This overview will be useful in both fleet and solo PVP, ratting, mining, looting, exploration etc. and in all types of space.

12 tabs, 38 overview presets, 3 bracket presets and 3 d-scan presets is the perfect balance between large complicated and too simplistic overviews. Alternative presets provide easy yet good customization for your playstyle.
