### Alexa Iridium

Being immortal capsuleer is hard; however wast the darkness of space, we must supply our own light and purpose. Alexa chose the excitement of PVP. She likes and seeks the unique adrenaline rush, which happens only when warp scrambler activates or when the shields start to break. 

Alexa is part of Pandemic Horde Incorporated, which she joined shortly after its formation during the Querious exodus and Could Ring offensive against monkeys. During WWB, Alexa followed PH to Fade and later Pure Blind, Geminate, Kalevala Expanse and finally Perrigen Falls. The 7 years (and counting) spent in the same corporations speaks of her loyalty and dedication. 

For a long time, Alexa was one of the most active PVPers in the alliance often charting in top 100 in the alliance and corporation on zkill.

Even the best lose ships sometimes, however losing a ship in a battle is no problem for her, for our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more. Every loss in a new opportunity to improve, learn and become even more powerful.

Supreme excellence consists of breaking enemy's resistance without fighting and never interrupting the enemy when he is making a mistake, which is how Alexa maintains her effectivity.

Alexa values freedom and independence, which is why you can find her partaking in an activity called solo PVP, which is akin to playing on hard mode, especially in a place where n+1 easily wins. 

There is no such thing as "a fair fight" or "an unfair fight". There's only a fight. Circumstances are irrelevant. Winner gets to set the rules and write the history, that is why Alexa seeks knowledge, ISK, experience, tools and friends, which are all needed to win.

Alexa is always happy to help a new capsuleer, yet she will mercilessly hunt them the moment they leave the safety of hisec, for a light without a shadow would be blinding to our eyes, comparable with the deepest darkness and EVE without pirates would be purposeless stagnant void. EVE is not dead yet.

### Thomas Iridium

It was the year YC105, when Thomas left his home system of Todaki for the first time. Not much is known about what he did back then and what identity he used. Some speculate that he spent some time attending EVE University and was later affiliated with the Guristas pirates, others say that he was just a miner in Nonni system who never left the safety of hisec.

Around the year YC117, under the name of Thomas Iridium, he and Alexa Iridium co-founded the New Eden Independent Corporation, of which he later become the CEO. The company was originally located in Nonni and is currently based from Isikano in cooperation with Wiyrkomi Peace Corps. Its main activities are trade on the Jita 4-4 and Hek M12 markets, hauling of various goods shipments around the star cluster, custom parts and ship manufacturing, management of planetary assets and intelectual property brokering.

Thomas Iridium is the mysterious leader of IridiumOps - relatively small and currently disbanded group of capsuleers interested in intel gathering and mercenary work.

Under his leadership, dedication of the New Eden Independent Corporation to the independent pilots of New Eden and all members of the pirate cabal of the star cluster, especially Guristas pirates (long live the Rabbit), remains strong and unchanged. There are also rumors about his cooperation with Triglavians.

Thomas Iridium occasionally expresses his disdain for null krabs, hisec carebears and the nullsec elite whose hostile politics caused downfall and disbandment of many smaller entities, including IridiumOps, and forced their members to become nameless F1 monkeys for either side of the current cosmic duopoly in order to access reasonable PVP content and nullsec only features like capital warfare and industry where CCP's system design makes competition impossible outside of large scale and vertically integrated enterprises located in Upwell facilities.

Despite this, New Eden Independent Corporation maintains sensible and centrist position between opposing current nullsec establishment regime and supporting revolutionary forces looking to create chaos, anarchy and entropy in the regions beyond the four empires; a position that is beneficial to all shareholders of the New Eden Independent Corporation.

Expert in CONCORD technology, Thomas Iridium sometimes works on UI modifications, GalNet chat channels, overview packs, 3rd party tools and reverse engineering of sleeper artefacts.

Lumia is always surrounded by spreadsheets. She manages planetary industry, gas extraction and mining operations as well as manufactoring and research projects. 

In her free time Lumia consumes Cerebral Accelerators and works on her political and philosophical masterpiece titled *Don't tread on the Rabbit*, which summarizes the state of the four main empires in following short statements: 

 - Amarr are backward feudal zealots.
 - Minmatar are dumb and dirty slaves.
 - Gallente are libtard degenerates.
 - Caldari are corporate puppets.
 - Only Guristas are free!

She currently works on chapter named "Could the Triglavians be right?"
